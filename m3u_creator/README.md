# M3uCreator

This tiny tool is intended to create a m3u file from a set of folders in a root
directory.

I first created this as a ruby script as I used it to create m3u files for my
car audio system. Doing it in Elixir seemed a good idea to learn from.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `m3u_creator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:m3u_creator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/m3u_creator](https://hexdocs.pm/m3u_creator).
